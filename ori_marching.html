        <h3>Open Ranks Inspection</h3>
        <p>Open ranks inspections focus on military bearing and personal appearance. Any cadet who receives a total of four or more discrepancies during a single open ranks inspection will be counseled appropriately.</p>
        <p>Flights being inspected will march to the inspection area, position themselves at the proper location, and stand at parade rest. The Cadet Flt/CC will be posted six paces to the front of, centered on, and facing away from the flight. When the inspector approaches, the Cadet Flt/CC will call the flight to attention, salute the inspector, and offer a verbal greeting. The inspector will direct the Cadet Flt/CC to prepare the flight for inspection at which time the Cadet Flt/CC salutes the inspector and does an about face. The Cadet Flt/CC then gives the command "Open ranks, March," and then immediately walks at a 45-degree angle to position him/herself one pace to the guidon bearer's right side and then faces down the line. The Cadet Flt/CC then proceeds to align the flight starting with the First Element and ending with the Third Element.</p>
        <p>Once the flight is aligned, the Cadet Flt/CC positions him/herself three paces in front of the guidon bearer's right side, facing down the line. The first element will now be three paces to the left of the Cadet Flt/CC. The Cadet Flt/CC will command "Ready front."</p>
        <p>The Cadet Flt/CC takes one step forward, conducts a right face, and salutes the inspector (who has positioned him/herself immediately in front of the Cadet Flt/CC) and reports, "Sir (Ma'am), ___ Flight is prepared for inspection." The inspector returns the salute and begins to inspect the Cadet Flt/CC. 53</p>
        <p>While the Cadet Flt/CC is being inspected, the Cadet Flt/CD takes one step to the rear, conducts a right face, and marches to a position one pace to the right and one pace to the front of the guide. He/she faces down line and prepares to record the inspection results.</p>
        <p>Once completed inspecting the Cadet Flt/CC, the inspector asks the Cadet Flt/CC to accompany him/her on the inspection. Both the Cadet Flt/CC and Cadet Flt/CD will accompany the inspector; the Cadet Flt/CD documents discrepancies on the ORI Discrepancy Roster.</p>
        <p>After being inspected, the Cadet Flt/CC executes a left face (down line) and commands, "Second and third elements, parade rest." The inspector takes the necessary steps forward to inspect the guidon bearer. The Cadet Flt/CD, who is still positioned in front of the guidon bearer, continues to face down the line. The Cadet Flt/CC executes a half left in marching without arm swing and halts one pace to the right and one pace to the rear of the inspector. (This causes the Cadet Flt/CC to precede the inspector and the Cadet Flt/CD to follow the inspector.) Cadet Flt/CD continues to face the inspector during the inspection, documenting any discrepancies. These positions are maintained throughout the inspection of the front of each respective rank. After completing the front inspection of each cadet, the inspector looks to the right to signal to the Cadet Flt/CC he/she is ready to move. When moving from individual to individual during the inspection, the inspector and Cadet Flt/CC simultaneously execute a facing movement to the right in marching and an in- place halt as described in section 7 below. (Cadet Flt/CD faces the inspector and simply takes one step forward for each inspector and Cadet Flt/CC movement).</p>
        <p>The movement is executed by pivoting 90 degrees to the right on the ball of the right foot, simultaneously stepping over the right foot with the left foot and placing the left foot parallel to the rank being inspected. Then advance one short step with the right foot, and place the right foot pointed toward the flight. Next bring the left heel into the right heel, and once again reassume the position of attention. The upper portion of the body remains at the position of attention, and the arm swing is suspended throughout when inspecting the front of each rank.</p>
        <p>These movements should place the inspector directly in front of the next individual to be inspected, still preceded by the Cadet Flt/CC and followed by the Cadet Flt/CD. After the inspector has inspected the last individual in the front rank, the Cadet Flt/CC hesitates momentarily and allows the inspector and Cadet Flt/CD to precede him or her as the inspector inspects the rear of the front rank. During the inspection of the rear of each rank, the Cadet Flt/CD follows the inspector approximately two paces to the rear, halting when the inspector halts. The Cadet Flt/CC will follow approximately two paces behind the Cadet Flt/CD, also halting with the inspector. After inspecting the rear of each rank, the inspector halts and turns in front of the element leader of the next rank. The Cadet Flt/CD marches past the rear of the inspector and reassumes the position following the inspector while the Cadet Flt/CC will halt and turn in front of the second person in the next rank (the Cadet Flt/CC is once again preceding the inspector). (These procedures are used to inspect the front and rear of subsequent ranks.)</p>
        <p>When the inspection party finishes inspecting the first element and before the inspector halts in front of the first person of the second element, the second element leader assumes the position of attention. The element leader turns his or her head approximately 45 degrees down line and commands, "Second element, Attention." When the first element leader can see the inspector out of the corner of his or her eye, the element leader turns his or her head down line and commands, "First element, parade rest." This procedure is repeated throughout the remaining elements.</p>
        <p>After the last element has been inspected from the rear, with the Cadet Flt/CD and Cadet Flt/CC following the inspector, the inspector will halt and execute an about face. The Cadet Flt/CD will halt while the Cadet Flt/CC will position him/herself one pace to the right of the Cadet Flt/CD, halt, and record the inspection results of the Cadet Flt/CD. The inspector inspects the Cadet Flt/CD and commands "POST". The Cadet Flt/CD will return to his/her position in the flight. The inspector marches off to the right flank (element leaders) of the flight while the Cadet Flt/CC proceeds directly to a position three paces beyond the front rank, halts, faces to the left (down line), and commands, "Flight, attention." The Cadet Flt/CC then takes one step forward with arm swing and faces to the right. The inspector marches to a position directly in front of the Cadet Flt/CC and gives comments. After receiving comments, the Cadet Flt/CC will salute and greet the departing official appropriately, "Good morning (afternoon or evening), Sir (Ma'am)". The inspector then executes the appropriate facing movement to depart. To conclude the activity, the Cadet Flt/CC will command, "Close ranks, march" before posting three paces in front of and centered on the flight. The flight will then be ready for the next scheduled activity.</p>
