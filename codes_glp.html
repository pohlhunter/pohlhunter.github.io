        <h3>Secret Codes GLP</h3>
        <p>Your group's task is to match each of the nuclear munitions with its base, secret code, yield, and the aircraft used to deliver it. All team members have access to this sheet.</p>
        <p>Each team member will receive at least one “secret code data slip”. During the activity you may discuss the information on the cards that were assigned to you, but you may not pass the slips around for others to see, in any form.</p>
        <br> <br>
        <h3>Five nuclear munitions (in no specific order):</h3>
