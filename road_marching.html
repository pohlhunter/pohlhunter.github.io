        <h3>Road Guard Procedures</h3>
        <h4>General Information</h4>
        <p>Road guards will wear a fluorescent/reflective vest during all hours of the day while performing this duty and will carry a flashlight during hours of darkness.</p>
        <p>Each flight will use their own road guards and will not "piggyback" on other flights (for example: March more than one unit across the street without allowing traffic to proceed between them) unless directed to do so by FTU staff.</p>
        <p>The Cadet Flt/CC will render all courtesies for the flight. If an officer (on foot) or staff vehicle passes (from the front) the person in charge will render courtesies. If a staff vehicle approaches the flight while crossing an intersection the road guard will not salute (due to safety). The person in charge will march the flight across the street, halt the flight, call in the road guards, and then render courtesies to the staff vehicle. Safety is the priority in this situation.</p>
        <h4>Procedures</h4>
        <p>For safety reasons, flights will always be halted six paces from the edge of the crossing.</p>
        <p>Road guards will wear road guard vests at all times while marching.</p>
        <p>Road guards will always fall into the rear of the flight.</p>
        <p>Both squadron and flight marching utilize the same processes listed below</p>
        <p>Prior to moving as a flight, the Cadet Flt/CC will command, "Road guards, don your gear".</p>
        <p>While approaching an intersection, approximately 10 paces away, the Cadet Flt/CC will command "Road guards, out." The road guards will run from the rear of the flight, safely move ahead of the flight, and safely proceed into the intersection to stop traffic.</p>
        <p>If required, the Cadet Flt/CC can call a specific amount of road guards out of the flight (i.e. "two road guards, out" or "four road guards, out").</p>
        <p>If vehicles are proceeding through the intersection, the road guard(s) will raise their hand(s) and the Cadet Flt/CC will halt the flight. The Road guards will then allow the vehicle to pass through the intersection and then proceed into the roadway to stop any other traffic while the Cadet Flt/CC marches the flight through the intersection.</p>
        <p>If utilizing squadron marching, when the squadron enters the road way, the rear flight's road guards will run forward and tap out the front flight's road guards in time for the first road guards to return to the rear of their flight.</p>
        <p>After the flight passes through the intersection, the Cadet Flt/CC will command, "Road Guards, In" without halting the flight.</p>
        <p>At the command of "Road Guards, In" the road guards will return to the rear of the flight.</p>
        <p>When arriving at the flight's final destination, the Cadet Flt/CC will give the command "Road guards, secure your gear." Road guards will then stow their gear in preparation for the flight's next task.</p>
