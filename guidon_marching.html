        <h3>Guidon</h3>
        <p>Field Training Specific</p>
        <p>Each flight of six or more cadets will carry their guidon from start to end of the academic day while marching from one location to another on Maxwell AFB, except when specifically instructed by staff not to.</p>
        <p>The guidon will be carried to all events except the LRC, PT, and other events as directed by FTU staff. If there is no guidon holder at the event, the guidon bearer will make every effort to ensure the guidon is stored/displayed properly and will not become a safety hazard. Guidons will not be posted by jamming them into the ground</p>
        <p>Storage of the Guidon. Flight guides are responsible for storing the guidon in the appropriate rack when not in use. Guidons will not be placed with the tip of the ornament on the ground or with the pennant wrapped tightly around the staff. If entering a building that does not have a storage rack, cadets will take the guidon inside with them and place it out of the way, leaning into a corner so that it will not fall. (NOTE: When entering a building with a guidon, cadets will announce "GUIDON" in order to alert others in the area to the hazard.)</p>
        <p>Cadets will take care of the guidon. If any part of the guidon breaks, cadets will not attempt to repair it. They will take the guidon to their FTO or CTA for repair.</p>

        <p>Section 5C - Manual of the Guidon</p>
        <h4>The Guidon</h4>
        <p>The guidon is carried at ceremonies and on other occasions when prescribed by the commander. The guidon bearer is a specially selected Airman designated by the squadron commander.</p>
        <h4>Order Guidon</h4>
        <p>Order guidon is the position of attention as shown in the photo below. The guidon bearer holds the guidon in a vertical position and keeps the ferrule on the ground beside the right shoe. The guidon bearer holds the staff in the right hand in the 'V' formed by the thumb and by the fingers extended and joined. The right hand and arm are kept behind the staff with the arm bent naturally and the staff resting against the hollow of the shoulder.</p>

        <h4>Carry Guidon</h4>
        <p>Carry guidon is the position in which the ferrule is approximately 6 inches from the ground. Facings, alignments, and formal marchings require carry guidon. The guidon bearer keeps the staff in a vertical position throughout the movements and brings it to carry guidon on the preparatory command for the movement. When marching at route step or at ease, the guidon bearer may hold the guidon in either hand at the carry position.</p>
