        <p>“Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” -Sir Winston Churchill</p>

        <p>“Servant leadership...It’s the notion of being part of something bigger than yourself and of making the people around you better.

        <p>“Treating EVERY Airman with dignity and respect must be at the heart of who we are and how we operate...Every single person around you brings something to the fight that you don’t. Each of them is critically important to mission success...” -General Mark A. Welsh III, USAF</p>

        <p>“Guardians don’t come to work every day for space’s sake. They do it because, when we win in space, our Joint Force wins, our allies and partners win, future generations win” -General John W. Raymond, USSF</p>
