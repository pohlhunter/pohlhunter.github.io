        <h3>Column Movements</h3>
        <h4>Column Right (Left)</h4>
        <p>The commands are Column Right (Left), MARCH and Forward, MARCH*</p>
        <p>&emsp; * According to Half Step, you can call a Halt after a Half Step, which is allows for either a Forward or Halt after a Column Movement.</p>
        <p>&emsp; Everything in '()' corresponds to doing a Left.</p>
        <p>The first (third) element leader takes one 24-inch step, (maintaining coordinated arm swing throughout) pivots 45 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the left (right) foot, and takes three 24-inch steps prior to pivoting 45 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the left (right) foot. Continue marching in 24-inch steps until even with the person who marches on the right (left). Then begin half stepping, and establish interval and dress. Each succeeding member of the first (third) element marches to the approximate pivot point established by the person in front of him or her and performs the same procedures as the element leader.</p>
        <p>The second (second) element leader takes one 24-inch step, (maintaining coordinated arm swing throughout) pivots 45 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the left (right) foot, and takes one 24-inch steps prior to pivoting 45 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the left (right) foot again once. Continue marching in 24-inch steps until even with the person who marches on the right (left). Then begin half stepping and establish interval and dress. Each succeeding member of the second (second) element marches to the approximate pivot point established by the person in front of him or her and performs the same procedures as the element leader.</p>
        <p>The third (first) element leader takes one 24-inch step, pivots 90 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the left (right) foot, and suspends arm swing during the pivot. Following the pivot, step off in a 24-inch step and resume coordinated arm swing. Beginning with the second step after the pivot, take up the half step. Each succeeding member of the third (first) element marches to the approximate pivot point established by the person in front of him or her and performs the same procedures as the element leader.</p>
        <p>The guide performs the pivots and steps exactly as the third element leader. Following completion of the pivots, the guide continues in a 24-inch step until he or she is ahead of the third element leader. The guide pivots 45 degrees to a position in front of the third element leader; then he or she pivots 45 degrees again toward the front and begins half stepping.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Column Right in simpler terms:</b></p>
        <p>First element does a step then pivot 45 degrees to the right, take three steps, pivot 45 degrees to the right again.</p>
        <p>Second element does a step then pivot 45 degrees to the right, take one step, pivot 45 degrees to the right again.</p>
        <p>Third element does a step then pivot 90 degrees to the right, take one full step, go into half step.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h4>Column Half Right (Left)</h4>
        <p>&emsp; Everything in '()' corresponds to doing a Left.</p>
        <p>To change the direction of a column by 45 degrees, the command is Column Half Right (Left), MARCH. On the command MARCH, the leading cadet of the right (left) flank advances one full 24-inch step, pivots 45 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the left (right) foot, and advances another full 24-inch step, maintaining coordinated arm swing. The cadet then takes up the half step and continues in a half step until each member in his or her rank is abreast of each other.</p>
        <p>Then all members of that rank resume a full 24-inch step. In the meantime, the remaining individuals of the leading rank pivot 45 degrees to the right (left), with coordinated arm swing and without changing the interval, and continue marchingin full 24-inch steps until they are abreast of the base file.</p>
        <p>At this point, they conform to the step of the individual in the right (left) flank and establish the proper interval. The remaining cadet in each file march to the approximate pivot point established by the element leader and perform the movement in the same manner. They then dress to their right and cover directly behind the person in front of them.</p>
        <p>The flight commander and guide pivot 45 degrees in the direction of the movement. Then they pivot 45 degrees back to their original positions in front of the column.</p>
        <p>When column half left is executed from a halt, the procedures are the same as described above except, on the command of execution, the element leaders begin the movement by executing a face in marching to the indicated direction.</p>
