        <h3>Formations and Forming the flight</h3>
        <p>Formation of a flight. Line and inverted line formation. Column and inverted column formation.</p><br>
        <h3>Formation of a flight</h3>
        <p>A flight forms in at least two, but not more than four, elements in line formation. The command is FALL IN.</p>
        <p>The command is FALL IN. On this command, the guide takes a position facing the flight commander and to the flight commander's left so the first element will fall in centered on and three paces from the flight commander. Once halted at the position of attention, the guide performs an automatic dress right dress.</p>
        <p>When the guide feels the presence of the first element leader on their fingertips, the guide executes an automatic ready front. Once positioned, the guide does not move.</p>
        <p>The first element leader falls in directly to the left of the guide and, once halted, executes an automatic dress right dress. The second and third element leaders fall in behind the first element leader, execute an automatic dress right dress, visually establish a 40-inch distance, and align themselves directly behind the individual in front of them. The remaining cadets fall into any open position to the left of the element leaders and execute an automatic dress right dress to establish dress and cover.</p>
        <p>To establish interval, the leading individual in each file obtains exact shoulder-to-fingertip contact with the individual to their immediate right.</p>
        <p>As soon as dress, cover, interval, and distance are established, each cadet executes an automatic ready front on an individual basis and remains at the position of attention.</p>
        <p>Once it is formed, the flight will be squared off prior to sizing. The left flank of the formation will be squared off with extra cadets filling in from the third to the first element.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Dress Right (Left) Dress (Line/Inverted Line Formation)</h3>
        <p>The commands are Dress Right, DRESS and Ready, FRONT. On the command DRESS, everyone except the last cadet in each element raises and extends the left arm laterally from the shoulder with snap so the arm is parallel with the ground. As the arm is raised, un-cup the hand at approximately waist level, keeping the palm down. Extend and join the fingers and place the thumb along the forefinger. At the same time as the left arm is raised, each individual (except the guide and second, third, and fourth element leaders) turns head and eyes 45 degrees to the right with snap. The leading individual of each file establishes normal interval (by taking  small choppy steps and aligning with the base file) and establishes exact shoulder-to- fingertip contact with the individual to the immediate right. The second, third, and fourth  element leaders align themselves directly behind the person in front of them (using small choppy steps) and visually establish a 40-inch distance. As the remaining members align themselves behind the individual in front of or to the right of them, their shoulders may or may not touch the fingertips of the individual to their right. If the arm is too long, place the extended hand behind the shoulder of the individual to the left. If the arm is too short, leave it extended toward the individual to the left and parallel to the ground. Oncedress, cover, interval, and distance have been established, the command Ready, FRONTwill be given. On this command, cadets whose arms are up will lower their arms withsnap to their sides (without slapping their sides) and re-cup their hands when their arm isat approximately waist level. As the arm is lowered, cadets whose heads are turned willreturn their heads to the front with snap. The body is now back to the position ofattention.</p>
