        <h3>Squadron Marching</h3>
        <h4>FAQ:</h4>
        <p>When falling in as a squadron, how far apart should flights be from each other? 3 paces.</p>
        <p>On the command REPORT, which flight is first to salute and report accountability? The flight to the right.</p>
        <p>When a squadron is prepared to execute a movement, which part of the command to flight commanders echo from the squadron commander? The preparatory command. Example: Squadron Commander: RIGHT Flight Commander: RIGHT Squadron Commander: FACE</p>
        <p>When squadron movements are to be executed in successive order, such as column movements, the second flight commander gives what command instead of echoing? Second flight commander states: CONTINUE THE MARCH.</p>
        <p>When squadron movements are to be executed in successive order from a halt, such as a column movement, the second flight commander gives what command instead of echoing? Second flight commander states: FORWARD.</p>
        <p>When falling in as a squadron, how many paces are there between the squadron commander and the flights? 9 paces.</p>
        <p>In what formation do squadrons typically march? Column formation.</p>
        <p>When the squadron is in column and it is desired to obtain the correct distance between flights, what is the command called by the squadron commander? The squadron commander states: CLOSE ON LEADING FLIGHT.</p>
        <p>What occurs when CLOSE ON LEADING FLIGHT is called? The leading flight commander commands the flight to take half steps. As soon as the correct distance has been obtained, each succeeding flight takes up the half step at its commander's command. When all flights have obtained the correct distance, the squadron commander gives Forward, MARCH, and all flights step off with a 24-inch step.</p>
        <p>What occurs when INITIATE ROLLING CADENCE is called The leading flight commander initiates a normal 8-count cadence loud enough for the squadron to hear. After the leading flight commander ends his 8-count cadence, the succeeding flight commander initiates the same cadence. This continues through all succeeding flights until the rearmost flight finishes. At this point the cadence returns to the leading flight and the cycle continues until CEASE ROLLING CADENCE is called.</p>
        <p>How many paces should the squadron/flight mark-time from an obstacle or road (without road guards deployed)? 6 paces</p>

        <h3>DNC: Squadron Marching</h3>
        <p>The following is straight from the DNC so the leadership position titles are not accurate.</p>
        <h4>The Squadron as a Drill Unit</h4>
        <p>A squadron consists of two or more flights. Only formations necessary for marches, drills, and ceremonies are prescribed in this chapter. The squadron forms in line with flights in line. When in column formation, the squadron is sized according to height, the tallest individuals to the front and right.</p>
        <p>The squadron does not execute marchings in line except for minor changes in position.</p>
        <h4>Commands</h4>
        <p>In squadron drill (except mass formation) when the individuals in the unit are to execute a movement together, the flight commanders repeat the preparatory commands of the squadron commander for facings, steps, and marchings except when the preparatory command of the squadron commander is Squadron. In this case, the flight commanders give the preparatory command Flight. When flights of the squadron are to execute a movement in successive order, such as a column movement while marching, the commander of A Flight repeats the squadron commander's preparatory command, and the commanders of the other flights give a supplementary command, such as CONTINUE THE MARCH. The flight commanders of the other flights repeat the squadron commander's preparatory command and command of execution so their flights execute the movement in approximately the same location as the first flight.</p>
        <p>If the squadron in column is at the halt when the squadron commander commands Column Right, the leading flight commander will supplement the command with COLUMN RIGHT. A t the same time, the remaining flight commanders command Forward. When the squadron commander commands MARCH, the leading flight executes column right, and the remaining flights march forward and execute the column movement on the command of their appropriate flight commanders. Each flight executes the movement at approximately the same location and in the manner as the first flight.</p>
        <p>To open ranks, the squadron commander faces the units and commands PREPARE FOR INSPECTION. The flight commanders, in successive order from the squadron commanders left to right, command their flights Open Ranks, MARCH. They align their flights and give the command Ready, FRONT.</p>
        <p>When the squadron is in column and it is desired to obtain the correct distance between flights, such as a column from standard mass formation, the command is CLOSE ON LEADING FLIGHT. On this command, the leading flight commander commands the flight to take up the half step. As soon as the correct distance has been obtained, each succeeding flight takes up the half step at its commander's command. When all flights have obtained the correct distance, the squadron commander gives Forward, MARCH, and all flights step off with a 24-inch step.</p>
        <p>When commands are given in which one flight is to stand fast or continue to march while other flights do not, the appropriate flight commander commands STAND FAST or CONTINUE THE MARCH.</p>
        <p>In giving commands, flight commanders may include the letter of their flights; for example, A Flight, HALT or B Flight, Forward. Flight commanders do not repeat the squadron commander's combined commands.</p>
        <h4>Forming the Squadron in Line</h4>
        <p>The squadron is formed in line with flights in line by the first sergeant, who takes an initial post nine paces in front of the point where the center of the squadron is to be, faces that point, and commands FALL IN. On the command FALL IN, the squadron forms in two or more flights with normal interval between individuals (unless close interval is directed) and a three-pace interval between flights.</p>
        <p>While positioning units in an area, the command is _____ Paces Forward, MARCH or _____ Steps Backward, MARCH. In backward march, the Airman takes 12-inch steps backward (starting with the left foot) and maintains normal arm swing. These commands are used for short distances only of four paces (steps) or less.</p>
        <p>Each flight sergeant takes a post three paces in front of and centered on the flight. The flights then form as prescribed under the supervision of the flight sergeants.</p>
        <p>The flight sergeants then command REPORT. Remaining in position, the element leaders in succession from front to rear of each flight salute and report _____ Element, all present or _____ Element, (number) person(s) absent. The flight sergeants then face about.</p>
        <p>Upon receiving the command REPORT given by the first sergeant, the flight sergeants, beginning with the right flight, successively salute and report _____ Flight, all present or accounted for or _____ Flight, (number) persons absent. After all flights have reported, the first sergeant commands POST. The flight sergeants face about and move by the most direct route to their positions in the ranks. The squadron commander takes a position 12 paces in front of, centered on, and facing the squadron to receive the report of the first sergeant. The guidon bearer assumes a position with the commander. The first sergeant faces the squadron commander, salutes, and reports Sir (Ma'am), all present or accounted for or (number) persons absent. Without a command, the first sergeant faces about and moves by the most direct route to the appropriate position.</p>
        <p>Flight commanders immediately take their posts after the first sergeant has reported.</p>
